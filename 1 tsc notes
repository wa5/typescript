The TypeScript Compiler
The TypeScript compiler is itself a .ts file compiled down to JavaScript (.js) file.
The TSC (TypeScript Compiler) is a source-to-source compiler (transcompiler / transpiler).

TypeScript Compiler
The TSC generates a JavaScript version of the .ts file passed to it. In other words, 
the TSC produces an equivalent JavaScript source code from the Typescript file given as an input to it. This process is termed as transpilation.

However, the compiler rejects any raw JavaScript file passed to it. The compiler deals with only .ts or .d.ts files.
